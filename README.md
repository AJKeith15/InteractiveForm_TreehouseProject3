This is the 3rd project in the Team Treehouse Full Stack Tech Degree program.

The code displays a form for registering users for a conference. This project was a test of form input, manipulation, and validation. Many of the fields have active validation as the user provides input. Error messages are displayed for various fields. Registration is denied (the page does not reload) if the user's input is not valid for all fields and error messages are displayed throughout the page.

Submissions are not sent anywhere - the page just reloads to simulate a successful registration.
